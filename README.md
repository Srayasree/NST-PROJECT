# NST-PROJECT
A Neural Style Transfer (NST) project uses deep learning to apply the artistic style of one image to the content of another, creating a visually stunning blend of both. It typically uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs), especially pre-trained models like VGG-19, to extract and combine content and style features.
